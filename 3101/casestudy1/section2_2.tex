\subsection{Outline of Kantian Ethics}
Again we shall use Kantian ethics focusing on the actions, not end result. Some details are discussed in the previous case, the benefit here is the Kantian view regards individuals as equal and the central point of actions being able to scale universally without causing a contradiction. 
\subsection{Example of Kantian Ethics} 
I want something, so I should steal it from someone who has it. Allowing stealing to be accepted as a universal law, would lead to no one having anything that is ones own. Personal property rights would not be able to exist. Working for money would no be possible because contracts need not be followed.
