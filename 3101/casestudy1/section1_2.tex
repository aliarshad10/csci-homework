\subsection{Outline of Kantian Ethics}
Kantian ethics focuses on the action itself and not consequences of action. One formulation is ``one ought to respect human beings as such and not used them as mere instruments for one's purpose''. The Kantian view regards each human life as valuable, and deserving of respect. The central point revolves around actions being able to scale universally without causing a contradiction. Actions are not taken based on feelings or because of a reward outcome (Utility), rather actions are taken because of ones duty.
\subsection{Example of Kantian Ethics}
If I disagree with a person, I should kill them. This example cannot be scaled universally. Aside from giving very little value to human life, if this were morally acceptable, everyone who has been disagreed with would end up being killed. Eventually the human race would kill itself off.
