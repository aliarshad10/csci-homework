A subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding into the subarachnoid
spaceâ€”the area between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater
surrounding the brain. This may occur spontaneously, usually
from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, or may result from head
injury. Symptoms include an intense headache with a rapid onset
("thunderclap headache"), vomiting, and an altered level of
consciousness.
