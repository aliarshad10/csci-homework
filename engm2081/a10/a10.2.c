/**
Write a function called  concat which takes two strings as input,  s1 and  s2 and returns a new string in which the second string is concatenated 
(added to) on to the end of the first string. In other words the new string consists of all the characters of  s1 up to but not including the null 
character followed by all the characters in  str2 including the final null character. For example, if  s1 is ``agree'' and  s2 is ``able'', the new 
string would contain ``agreeable''. Include a main program which tests your function.
