/**
Write a program,  changename.c, which takes a filename as input and produces a filename with a different extension as output.

Most filenames consist of two parts, the basename (everything to the left of the last `.' character), and the extension (everything to the right of 
the last `.' character). Often, we wish to name our output files something similar to our input files, and changing the extension is a convenient way 
to do this. For example, if the input file is called "myprog.in", then an appropriate output file name would be "myprog.out".

Write your program to first read a string (with no spaces in it) from the keyboard. This is the `input' filename (although we are not actually going 
to be reading from it). The program then creates an `output' string which is a a copy of the input string except that everything after the last `.' 
character is replaced with the extension `out'. The input string and the output string are written to a file having the output filename.
