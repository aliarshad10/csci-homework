/**
In some programs we would like to be able to determine the input and output file names at the time that the program is executed. Modify your  
minmaxd.c program from assignment 9 so that the main program prompts the user for the two file names and passes the input file name to the  readdat 
function. The function  readdat  now opens the input file to read the data and closes it when done. The main should open the specified output file to 
write out the results of the run.
