1.
	How do you define an operating system?
	I define an operating system as the platform that allows me to run programs on my computer.
	I define an operating system as the program that allows for the use of my system hardware,
		In a way which is convienent and allows me to be productive. And avoid interacting directly
		with the system hardware. It is an interface for my computer.

2.	The operating system should allow the user to execute programs.
	The operating system should handle the I/O with the system hardware.
	The operating system should handle interupts and avoid "crashing".
	The operating system should handle task management and CPU time.

3.	The user is generally only interested in what they are doing, and they don't need to be 
		distracted by all the background tasks that don't require user input.
	
	I wouldn't call that an ideal: If I'm running servers I want to know all the processes that
	are being run on the computer
		
4.	When handling errors, exceptions and weighting process priority it is good to have the user
		seperate from the system tasks

5.	Batch: this type of operating system runs programs as they come in through a queue.
		They are generally used behind the scenes because they don't like to be interupted,
		but are very stable at doing certain repetative tasks, like system backups.
		Generally someone writes the batch files and send them off to be processed, meanwhile they
		wait for the computer to do process the batch files in sequence.
	Interactive: this is your typical operating system, it expects lots of interups and IO support.
		The sustem needs to be able to handle just about anything the user can "throw at it".
		Generally when a user wants something done, it will do it.
	Time Sharing: this is your big corprate server, or modern Cloud environment. It must disguise
		the fact that there are many users on the system all sharing the CPU(s).
