The purpose of this lab was to investigate the use of the Proportional Integral Derivative controller algorithm in a wall-following robot exercise. A Proportional Integral Derivative controller, also known as a PID controller, utilizes the variance between the desired state of the function and the actual state of the function (the robot's behaviour being the function in this case) and is represented by \referenceEquation{pid-function}.
