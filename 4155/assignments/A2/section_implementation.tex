\section{Implementation}\label{section_implementation}
Implementation of the PID controller function was straight forward. The time consuming part of the process was finding optimal values for the constants $K_{P}$, $K_{I}$ and $K_{D}$ seen in \referenceEquation{pid-function}. During this process, we also tried different methods to avoid erroneous values. After testing with sampling and averaging, we decided not to because very little difference was noticed. Instead we returned to only adjusting the constants $K_{P}$, $K_{I}$ and $K_{D}$. Where our robot fails frequently is when the distance from the robot to the instantaneous center of rotation is less than the distance from the robot to the wall. In this case, once the robot start to turn towards the wall, the sonar value increases even though the robot is actually closer to the wall. Resulting in the robot turning faster towards the wall. We discussed methods which we could fix this, a second ultrasonic sensor would be ideal. In the end we found values for the constants that worked to our satisfaction most of the time.
