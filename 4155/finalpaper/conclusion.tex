\section{Conclusion}
\label{section::conclusion}

We presented our project and our approach to the class and were pleased with our results. In the two runs we reached the goal on the first trial, and not on the second trial. In our final dozen tests, we managed to reach the goal in three quarters of the tests. We saw that the robot worked when commencing from any starting position and we were satisfied with these results in trials leading up to the final presentation. We were content with the simplicity of our solution. It proved to be more robust than other methods that relied on large training sets or hard coded camera transforms correcting skewing around the image edges. Our simple solution was designed to be robust and easy to use anywhere on any machine in as little time as possible.
