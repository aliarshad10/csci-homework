This paper presents our approach to navigate a Lego NXT robot through a dynamic environment. The robot must reach the end goal while avoiding contact with both moving and stationary obstacles. Data was combined from a birds eye view webcam, and the onboard sonar, light and touch sensors. Five possible moves were considered for each location of the robot and our controller algorithm would choose the move that would minimize the distance to the goal while avoiding obstacles. The final implementation was a greedy algorithm on policy approach which worked successfully for more than half of the trials. Learning from this project, possible changes to the approach will be discussed for future implementations.
