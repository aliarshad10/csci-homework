The robot was a Lego NXT tribot, two notable modifications were made.  First, mounting a third servomotor to allow the forward facing ultrasonic sensor to rotate. Second, coloured blobs were mounted above the front and rear of the robot to simplify the detection and calculate the direction of the robot. The project relied on Python, nxt-python\footnote{\url{http://code.google.com/p/nxt-python}}  and OpenCV\footnote{\url{http://opencv.org/}}  (versions 2.7.2, 2.2, 2.4.3 respectively). Development and testing was completed using software across Linux, Windows and Mac with different webcams without experiencing any added difficulty. Scikit-Learn was considered, to learn a function to translate from camera data to the robot's orientation.  This option was determined to be unnecessary because calculation of robotâ€™s direction can be done analytically with trigonometry.
