\section{Future Improvements}
\label{section::future}

Several future improvements could be made, three possible future enhancements are presented. First, add a more robust path planning algorithm. We went for keeping it simple. In our environment, we knew our greedy approach would work fast enough because of the simple box obstacles that needed to be avoided. In a more complex maze environment it is possible for our algorithm to fail and our robot to get stuck. Second, separate the code to a completely parallel implementation. It would be more efficient to have the vision processes, path planning and object avoidance all running as separate processes. This could be implemented by using the libraries provided by the Robot Operating System (ROS \footnote{\url{http://www.ros.org}} ) to pass data between different processes in a simple manner. The communication infrastructure provided by ROS would allow for the vision to be running continuously publishing the robotâ€™s location, while the path planning, object avoiding and line tracing all run concurrently instead of in sequence. Finally, it would be beneficial to add more machine learning methods, or a flexible controller architecture. This would enable the swapping of controllers in order to compare different machine learning methods. For our project, we chose the one that would work with our time constraints.
