The task at hand involved programming a robot to navigate to a goal on top of a table while avoiding obstacles and the edge. The system had to be responsive to changes in the environment, as the obstacles were not necessarily stationary. Machine learning techniques were incorporated to achieve a flexible and robust solution that would improve as the robot moved towards the goal. The sensors incorporated were: a standard definition webcam, ultrasonic distance sensor, light sensor and touch sensor. The camera was placed over the table to determine the position and orientation of the robot, the goal, and drivable regions. The light and touch sensors on the NXT were the backup sensors for avoiding the table edge and objects, respectively. The ultrasonic sensor was mounted on a servomotor to enable a check of multiple directions and incorporate the different distance measures into our overall controller.
